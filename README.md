>"Game programming is whack yo"

Who needs Google Docs when you have github.

## To-do list of features
- Clear all bullets on screen by pressing a key (DEBUG FEATURE)
- I'm probably gonna split the object_list into sub lists (Asteroids/Bullets/Player(s)), for collision detection so this would be easy to implement. 

- Add moving enemies
- Will do

## Notes
Can someone explain why x is associated with sin and y is associated with cos when that's not how trig normally works?.... Also why is cos multiplied by -1
